# Learning Scratch Implementations in Python

This repository focuses on learning basic implementations in Python.

## Dot Product Implementations

1. **2D Dot product:**
   - This implementation defines a function `dot` that computes the dot product of two matrices using nested loops and helper functions to calculate lengths, create matrices, and perform the dot product for lists.
   - It handles both 1D and 2D matrices and checks for dimension compatibility before performing the multiplication.

2. ** Multidimensional Dot product:**
   - This implementation extends the previous one by adding recursive functionality to handle higher-dimensional arrays.
   - It uses similar helper functions for length calculation and matrix creation, but it includes a recursive approach to compute the dot product for more complex matrix structures.
