# Learning Scratch Implementations in Python

This repository focuses on learning basic implementations in Python.

## Dot Product Implementations

1. **2D Dot product:**
   - This implementation defines a function `dot` that computes the dot product of two matrices using nested loops and helper functions to calculate lengths, create matrices, and perform the dot product for lists.
   - It handles both 1D and 2D matrices and checks for dimension compatibility before performing the multiplication.

2. **Multidimensional Dot product:**
   - This implementation extends the previous one by adding recursive functionality to handle higher-dimensional arrays.
   - It uses similar helper functions for length calculation and matrix creation, but it includes a recursive approach to compute the dot product for more complex matrix structures.

## JSON Manipulation and To-Do List Project

This  contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic JSON manipulation and a simple To-Do List application using Python's `json` module.

### JSON Manipulation

- Creates a JSON file (`data.json`) from a Python dictionary.
- Reads the JSON data back into a dictionary.
- Removes the `id` key if it exists and prints the modified dictionary.

### To-Do List Project

- Implements a simple To-Do List application that allows users to manage features and associated values.
- Features include:
  - Initializing a list of features.
  - Adding individual or multiple values to specified features.
  - Saving the current state of the To-Do List to a JSON file.
